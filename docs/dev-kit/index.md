# Development Kit

Kenx project setup contains a couple of useful tools to assist developers. These tools aim to give additional control and more insights of the project during the development process.

**Note**: As the name states, this kit is available only for development. The general setup by default, disables inclusion of this kit in production built and we strongly recommand to developers to leave it as so. For best practice, it's only enable in production mode during maintenance if [API Compliance]() plugin is supported and has maintenance handler `enabled`.
