## Create Kenx-node Application
Set up a modern web application by running one command.

1. Less to Learn
You don't need to learn and configure many build tools. Instant reloads help you focus on development. When it's time to deploy, your bundles are optimized automatically.

2. Only One Dependency
Your application only needs one build dependency. We test Create Kenx-node to make sure that all of its underlying pieces work together seamlessly – no complicated version mismatches.

3. No Lock-In
Under the hood, we use plugins to supports other amazing projects to power your application. If you ever want an advanced configuration, you can ”eject” from Kenx-node and edit their config files directly.

To create a project called my-app, run this command:

```bash
npx ckenx create --node my-app
```

To use the latest `ckenx` cli run the command with `@latest` tag

```bash
npx ckenx@latest create --node my-app
```
